classdef ESA_E4448A_class < handle
    % ESA_E4448A_class this class has the basic methods to use the OSA 
    % reference A6380, for further complex procedures needed for the
    % research field, feel free to modify the methods as you want and add
    % more if needed. Communication is done by ETHERNET TCP\IP by formatted
    % commands sent through, all this class is using its own properties.
